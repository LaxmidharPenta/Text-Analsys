# 🧠 Text Analysis Using Python

### 📘 Project Description
**Text Analysis Using Python** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that demonstrates how to process, analyze, and visualize textual data effectively using Python.  
The main objective of this project is to transform raw text data into meaningful insights by applying techniques such as tokenization, word frequency analysis, and data visualization.

This project can be used as a foundation for more advanced NLP applications like:
- Sentiment analysis  
- Topic modeling  
- Named entity recognition (NER)  
- Keyword extraction  
- Text summarization  

It is built with simplicity in mind, making it beginner-friendly yet extensible for more complex use cases.

## 🧐 Overview

This project provides a workflow for analyzing textual datasets stored in CSV format.  
The script `graph.py` loads text data from `data.csv`, processes it (tokenization, cleaning, etc.), and visualizes patterns using charts and graphs.

It’s useful for:
- Understanding common words and themes in text data  
- Performing exploratory text data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizing textual patterns (like word frequency, length distribution, etc.)

## ✨ Features

✅ Text cleaning and preprocessing (remove punctuation, lowercasing, etc.)  
✅ Word frequency analysis and visualization  
✅ Easy-to-customize Python script (`graph.py`)  
✅ CSV-based dataset (`data.csv`) for demonstration  
✅ Modular structure — can be extended for more NLP tasks

## 🧰 Dependencies / Requirements

Make sure the following packages are installed (already listed in `requirements.txt`):

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
nltk
wordcloud
scikit-learn
```

> 🐍 **Python Version:** 3.8 or later is recommended.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaxmidharPenta/Text-Analsys.git
   cd Text-Analsys
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
   # or
   source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/Mac)
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(Optional)** If using NLTK, download necessary datasets:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Place your text data in the `data.csv` file.  
   The file should have at least one column containing text entries (e.g., `Text`, `Review`, etc.).

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python graph.py
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Load and process the text data  
   - Generate word frequency distributions  
   - Create visual graphs and charts  

4. Example (inside a Python script):
   ```python
   from graph import analyze_text

   analyze_text("data.csv")
   ```

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can try out the live Streamlit application here:

👉 **[Text Analysis Using Python - Streamlit App](https://s5rngy5cqgen9wjcnoqs7g.streamlit.app/)**

This hosted app allows users to:
- Upload their own text data or use sample text  
- View real-time word frequency charts and text statistics  
- Visualize key textual insights through interactive graphs  
- Explore the power of Python NLP and visualization tools directly in the browser  

No setup needed — just open the link and start analyzing!


## 🧩 Data

- **File:** `data.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains text samples used for analysis.  
- Each row typically includes one text entry (e.g., product review, sentence, or paragraph).  
- You can replace it with your own dataset for custom analysis.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Add sentiment analysis using TextBlob or VADER  
- Add Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy  
- Implement topic modeling using LDA  
- Interactive visual dashboards using Streamlit
